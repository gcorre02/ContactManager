Programming in Java Course Work 2 Deliverable.

Notes :

All classes that aren't part of the original description but work as components for the main project are organized under package mytools.
Coded in eclipse, only source files are in the repository. 
All tests are organized in a package called test for each package of source code.
JUnit 4 was used for testing, no other libraries apart from Java.utils were used.
